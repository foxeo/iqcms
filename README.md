// IQ CMS 0.4.2 by Otismo Web Design (http://iqcms.onfav.net | http://iqcms.com | http://owd.me)

// Thank you for downloading IQ CMS, IQ CMS Tech Blog,

// and IQ CMS Florida SunShine Template !

// Setup - Here's a quick start on how to set up IQ CMS :

// 1. Extract the zipfile iqcms.zip

// 2. Upload all the files to your server.

// 3. Open up the page where you uploaded the files.

// 4. Clicking its login link in the footer will take you to

// your new TiNiLiL File Mgr Login Page; username and password will work

// initially, but you should change them right away ( follow the instructions ).

// 5. Once you have logged in to your TiNiLiL File Mgr, you will see everything.

// Go to your Files Folder. This contains the Flat File (textfile) database that

// controls all of your website content. You control, add, and delete content by

// editing the text files in your Files Folder. Remember that Pagename text files,

// which contain the content of your web pages, must begin with a capital letter.
 
// 6. To add a new page, simply create a new page file; it must begin with a capital letter.

// Also edit the menu text file, to add your new web page to the website page menu;

// the menu will display in the order that you have chosen in your menu text file edit. 

// 7. You can also edit your website's title, slogan, footer, copyright, key words

// and description, all by editing their corresponding text files. For Instance :

// when editing copyright.txt, replace "http://iqcms.onfav.net" with your website's URL;

// then replace "IQ CMS" with the name of your website. Be sure to save the file !

// 8. Always remember to back everything up - and Have Fun !

// 9. IMPORTANT - Be sure .htaccess properly reflects the folder the CMS is installed in

// (if IQ CMS is installed in the root folder .htaccess should be O.K.).

// Everything should work just fine -

// but if you are getting errors when trying to navigate to pages,

// you may have to edit your .htaccess file:

// In cases where IQ CMS does not run from the root folder of a domain, 

// you will have to change the "RewriteBase" line to something like this:

// RewriteBase /path/to/iqcmsfolder/

// 10. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS for City Tech Blog Users : City skylines have been included -

// in the img folder, rename OOtech_02.jpg to tech_02.jpg for Orlando FL;

// rename MEtech_02.jpg to tech_02.jpg for Minneapolis MN;

// rename OEtech_02.jpg to tech_02.jpg for Omaha NE.

// 11. Special Instructions - for editing the side panel

// (the right-side vertical section of the Template).

// A file named Pagename-side.txt must be added

// to the Files folder for every new page you create.

// For example, if you create a new page called About,

// create a new file named About-side.txt in the files folder

// (be sure to capitalize the first letter of the new page name).

// The contents of this Pagename-side.txt file will now display in

// the side panel and be editable in your TiNiLiL File Mgr.

// 12. FOR BETTER SECURITY remove the Login link in copyright.txt

// and also the TiNiLiL File Mgr login link in index.php BE CAREFUL

// Just Remember the Login URL is YourWebsiteURL appended with /fm
